- A Telegram Bot Token (from <a href="https://t.me/botfather" target="_blank">@BotFather</a>) - **You must create your own bot**

   Or using pip:

3. **Create your own bot and get a token**
   
   > **Important**: You MUST create your own bot. Do NOT try to use the official MindMate bot token.

   - Create a new bot with `/newbot`
   - Give your bot a unique name (different from "Talk to Slimen")

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
